## <a id="step-1"></a> Exercise 1.6: Unicafe, step 1

Like most companies, the student restaurant of the University of Helsinki Unicafe collects feedback from its customers. Your task is to implement a web application for collecting customer feedback. There are only three options for feedback: _good_, _neutral_, and _bad_.

The application must display the total number of collected feedback for each category. Your final application could look like this:

![Final application](./docs/unicafe-final-application.png)

Note that your application needs to work only during a single browser session. Once you refresh the page, the collected feedback is allowed to disappear.

The `main.jsx` file is as follows:

```js
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(<App />);
```

You can use the code below as a starting point for the `App.jsx` file:

```js
import { useState } from "react";

const App = () => {
  // save clicks of each button to its own state
  const [good, setGood] = useState(0);
  const [neutral, setNeutral] = useState(0);
  const [bad, setBad] = useState(0);

  return <div>code here</div>;
};

export default App;
```

## <a id="step-2"></a> Exercise 1.7: Unicafe, step 2

Expand your application so that it shows more statistics about the gathered feedback: the total number of collected feedback, the average score (good: 1, neutral: 0, bad: -1) and the percentage of positive feedback.
