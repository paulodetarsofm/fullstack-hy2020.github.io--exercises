# Part 2 - Exercise Phonebook

- [Exercise 2.6: Phonebook, step 1](#step-1)

## <a id="step-1"></a> Exercise 2.6: Phonebook, step 1

Let's create a simple phonebook. **_In this part, we will only be adding names to the phonebook._**

Let us start by implementing the addition of a person to the phonebook.

You can use the code below as a starting point for the `App` component of your application:

```js
import { useState } from "react";

const App = () => {
  const [persons, setPersons] = useState([{ name: "Arto Hellas" }]);
  const [newName, setNewName] = useState("");

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Phonebook</h2>
      <form>
        <div>
          name: <input />
        </div>
        <div>
          <button type="submit">add</button>
        </div>
      </form>
      <h2>Numbers</h2>
      ...
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

The `newName` state is meant for controlling the form input element.

After finishing this exercise your application should look something like this:

!["Phonebook" application](./docs/phonebook-application.png)

Note the use of the React developer tools extension in the picture above!

**NB:**

- you can use the person's name as a value of the key property
- remember to prevent the default action of submitting HTML forms!
